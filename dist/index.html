              Probably, you often see the news about modern achievements of the Artificial Intelligence and neural networks. And their development is undoubtedly one of the greatest breakthroughs in the sphere of high technology. 
              However, all the news focuses on philosophic talks about possible consciousness of AI and danger of disappearance 
              of a great number of professions because of the AI development. And it’s even without considering the meatbags
              ’ fear to become batteries :)))
            </p>
            <p class="intro_text">
              We are from the Ukraine and despite of what is happening around us, we would like to show you that this world still has something positive. And what could be more positive and funnier than making one of the greatest 
              high-technology inventions of humanity develop new manicure designs? Moreover, no invention can be called 
              successful unless it is useful for the beautiful half of humanity.
            </p>
            <p class="intro_text">Our dream and final goal are to create an application that will generate a manicure design using a photo of your hand in real time.</p>
            <p class="intro_text">
              You can help our project to develop by donating us a couple of dollars. However, the best support and acknowledgement you can give us is a video or a photo posted with our manicure design on your nails, the hashtag #Bot_Byte_nails and 
              the link on our website or Pinterest. 
            </p>
            <p class="intro_text">
              Everyone who donates to the development of our project, we will send a gift individual design, which is not publicly available. Only one person will have this design – you</p>
            <p class="intro_text intro_text--end">Stay tuned, with love, Bot Byte.</p>
